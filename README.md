# PCA-linear-equations
Solve linear equations via PCA
pca解方程.md is the paper

## Main files

### Algorithm
- data: read input/ouput data
- utils: implement of the algorithm, the core of the project

### Illustration
- lineq: solving linear equations with pca and draw the error-curve
- lineq_perf: draw error-curve wrt components of A, (number of components of B is 4)
- lineq-perfB: draw error-curve wrt components of B
- report_pca: see the report

### Regression
regtest

### TODO

- [x] OOP for algorithm
- [ ] better API
