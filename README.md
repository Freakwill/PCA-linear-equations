### Illustration
- lineq: solving linear equations with pca and draw the error-curve
- lineq_perf: draw error-curve wrt components of A, (number of components of B is 4)
- lineq-perfB: draw error-curve wrt components of B
- report_pca: see the report

### Algorithm
- data: read input/ouput data
- utils: implement of the algorithm
